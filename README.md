## About

Chrome Web Extension built in TypeScript using Chrome API. Simple way to open highlighted text as a wikipedia article from either a right click menu, or a configurable keyboard shortcut. 

Currently under review for publishing in Chrome Web Store! :D 

## Usage 

1. At chrome://extensions, navigate to keyboard shortcuts.![Screenshot 2023-11-02 120007](https://github.com/arescrimson/WikiChrome/assets/66581240/79a51ef6-11d3-498a-92df-d7a9977c84cc)<br>

2. Configure the shortcut to your preferred keybind.

3. Configure the chrome extension popup to set/unset your active tab as the newly opened tab. <br>
